    "#### Our Changes\n",
    "1. The calculation for gradient is moved out from the optimize_function and is called only once before processing any image. This helps in saving RAM and gives faster computations.\n",
    "2. The various values for blur can be used to check out how the variations occur in the final image. The different values of blur are commented out in recursive_optimize function. It works well when the blur is 0.5. Other values (.25, 1.0) are in commented state and can be uncommented to compare the outputs.\n",
    "3. Each of the images - downscaled, upscaled, before and after running deepdream algorithm will be saved under images folder - for now the code is commented to save images. The users can uncomment the lines in optimize_image() and recursive_optimize() function to download all intermediate outputs, upscaled and downscaled images. If recursive function is executed, then all the intermediate images are saved with iteration number appended at the end.\n",
    "4. In order to test images for different layers, stepsize, rescale factor, number of iterations and number of repeats, the user can use the HTML form to vary the values, select a file (which is already present in the /images folder from where this notebook is running) and set these parameters. The fucntion - process_inputs() can be then executed to check the different variations. All the output images are stored in /images folder.\n",
    "5. The gradient is usually added in the image to produce smooth patterns. For analysis purpose, we subtracted the gradient from the image and then plotted these images which shows that patterns could not be produced if the gradient is subtracted. The code for subtracting gradient is commented out in optimize_function, this can be uncommented and can be tested for images."

    "\n",
    "This is the main function of the algorithm. The function takes input the layer-tensor (0-11), the image to be processed, the number of iterations, step size, tile size and show_gradient( to show the intermediate graphs). The function first obtains the gradient for the tensor layer which is basically first squares the tensor, then calculates the reduce_mean and then finds the gradient of this mean on the default graph. Once we obtain the gradient, we then iterate (the number of optimization we want to run) to blend the image with the patterns. The value of gradient is calculated to understand how we can change the image so as to maximize the mean of the given layer-tensor. The gradient is blurred in order to enhance the patterns and obtain a more smooth image. Finally the image is updated with the calculated gradient and this process is repeated for the number of iterations (by default it is 10)."

    "#### Recursive Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Inception Model was trained for a very low resolution images (200-300 pixels) in order to get proper results, the input image is downscaled and deepdream is run. But with downscaling the image, the results of the algorithm are not good, so the process of downscaling the image and running deep dream is done recursively to obtain proper patterns in the output image. Thus first the image is downscaled as per the num of repeats, now each of the downscaled image is passed to the optimize_image function along with adding it with the upscaled image. Thus we finally get the same size image as the original with enhanced patterns."

    "\n",
    "Running over different sets of parameters, we could see that a better result set is generated when we have a Rescale Factor between 0.4 - 0.8, number of iterations that we run Optimize function between 10-20 gives a smooth image with defined patterns. With less number of iterations, the patterns will not be visible. The recursive optimize function is run for atleast 4-5 times (parameter: number of repeats) and hence blends the image with more lines and patterns but if the number of repeats is increased too much, the output does not produces a smooth image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient plays a major role. Adding up different gradient with varying blur helps in creating a smooth final image where the patterns and the original image blends well. For a very high blur the original image itself looses the lines and smootheness. Thus a blur of 0.5 is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "For analysing and understanding, each of the intermediate ouputs can be saved - the codes are in commented form to avoid unnecessary saving of multiple files. These lines can uncommented to save each of the intermediate outputs. The final images are saved in the local drive in /images folder.\n"
