The images in this folder contains the result from running JackSparrow.jpg with different parameters:

1. TensorFlow Layer
2. Step Size
3. ReScaling Factor

Each Image obtained is named as deepdream_O<OriginalImageName>_TensorFlowLayer_StepSize_RescaleFactor - showing the result obtained after running just 
the optimize function and deepdream_O<OriginalImageName>_TensorFlowLayer_StepSize_RescaleFactor - showing the result obtained after running the 
recursive function.
